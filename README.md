# ID_Card_Information_Extraction

Feature detection is a common field of research in image processing and computer vision. In this project, I used the concept of feature detection to extract information from an image. In my model, I used an image of the student ID card of the University of Manitoba and extracted the user face and the student ID from that Image. Now, this information could be further useful for security purpose, Automatic Attendances system or library system of the University.
